        <h3>Lower The Cost of IV Therapy With One of Our Special Intro Offers!</h3>
        <p>Hydrate IV Bar is best-known for our spa’s menu of vitamin-infused IV therapy cocktails. All of our signature IV drips have 1 liter of saline paired with a blend of vitamins and nutrients. If any of our signature IV cocktails aren’t quite what you’re looking for, you can build your own IV drip! For an extra boost, many Hydrate IV Bar clients love to add an extra half or full bag of fluids to the end of their visit as well.</p>
    
       
        <p>
        We also offer vitamin injections, which are great quick pick-me-up options if you’re short on time but still need a healthy boost to get through your day. We have seven different vitamin shots to choose from: b12, MIC, D3, Tri-Immune, L-lysine, Amino Acids, and NAD+. Click here to learn more about each injection.</p>
        
       <p>Interested in adding IV therapy, vitamin injections, or NAD+ IV therapy to your wellness routine, but aren’t quite sure where to start? Scroll below to view each of our new client intro offers — some of our most popular services at discounted prices!</p>
        <p>NAD+ IV therapy is available at all of our Hydrate IV Bar spas. NAD+ (also known as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a coenzyme found in all living cells: it promotes cell regeneration, and can be beneficial for clients experiencing joint and muscle pain, stimulating sirtuins (proteins), which have anti-inflammatory properties, stabilizing hormones, improving mood, and increasing metabolism. NAD+ IV therapy can also be beneficial for better sleep, mental clarity, focus, energy, and the regulation of dopamine and serotonin levels. Click here to learn more about NAD+ IV therapy, and for our pricing.</p>

      <div className="benefits-section">
        <h1>WHAT TO EXPECT FROM YOUR NAD+ IV THERAPY</h1>
        <p>NAD+ IV therapy depends on your condition and the plan developed by your therapists. Appointments may consist of two to four-hour sessions of IV infusions over the course of two to three days. Throughout the session, you can still engage in light activities. Our comfortable and spacious spas allow you to work on your laptop, relax as you read a book, or play a game on your phone. If you simply want to relax, the comfort in our spa makes it possible to sleep during the sessions.</p>
        <p>While walk-in IV and injection appoinments are always welcome, we encourage you to book your appointment ahead of time. Appointments will help our team to accommodate all clients, and ensure that we have a recliner ready for you to relax and rehydrate in!

</p>
<p>Hydrate IV Bars relaxing atmosphere may feel like your favorite spa, but we take IV safety very seriously! All of our services — from IVs to injections — are administered by experienced, registered nurses. The only thing more comforting than the big recliners you get to kick back in is the assurance of knowing that you’re in good hands with our incredible staff.
