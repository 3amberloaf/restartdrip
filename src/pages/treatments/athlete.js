        <p className="hidden-text">
          Athlete recovery IV therapy combines essential nutrients such as magnesium, vitamin B12, and B complex vitamins to support rapid recovery and enhance performance. This specialized IV treatment delivers these nutrients directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system for immediate absorption and effectiveness.
        </p>
        <p className="hidden-text">
          Magnesium plays a crucial role in muscle function and relaxation, which is essential for athletes recovering from intense physical activity. Vitamin B12 supports red blood cell production, aids in energy metabolism, and helps maintain neurological function, all of which are vital for optimal athletic performance. B complex vitamins further contribute to energy production and help in the synthesis of new cells.
