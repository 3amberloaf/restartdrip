                                            Intravenous (IV) therapy involves delivering fluids, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients directly into the bloodstream through a vein. It's a medical treatment commonly used to rehydrate the body, replenish essential nutrients, and address various health concerns.

                                            IV therapy offers several benefits, including:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Rapid hydration.</li>

                                                <li>Boosted energy and immune function: helps improve energy levels, enhance immune function, and promote overall well-being.</li>
                                                <li>Targeted therapy: can be customized with specific nutrients to address individual health needs, such as vitamin deficiencies, fatigue, hangovers, and jet lag.</li>

                                            During IV therapy, a healthcare professional inserts a thin needle into a vein, typically in the arm, and connects it to a tube attached to a bag containing the desired fluids and nutrients. The infusion rate is controlled to ensure a steady flow of the solution into the bloodstream. This allows for quick absorption and utilization of the nutrients by the body. Sessions typically last 45 minutes to 1 hour.

                                                <li>Treatment session: During the IV therapy session, you'll relax in a comfortable setting while the IV is administered.</li>
                                                <li>Duration: IV therapy sessions typically last between 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the type of treatment and your individual needs.</li>
                                                <li>Aftercare: After the treatment, you may experience increased hydration, improved energy levels, and other immediate effects.</li>
